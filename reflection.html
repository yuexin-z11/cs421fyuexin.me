    <p>checked -- I had the amazing chance to visit the CMA CGM Headquarters in Marseille, France, where I was able to learn about their services and experiences. One of the top shipping companies in the world, they combine cutting-edge logistics technology with a strong dedication to environmental responsibility. They started off by going over the company's history, from its beginnings in Marseille to its first decision to expand to China. I was shocked to learn that they used a experienced executive who had just retired to manage operations in China, utilizing his extensive knowledge of the area. After a few speeches, I was also genuinely impressed by their commitment to sustainability and their continuous efforts to improve ship technology.</p>

    <p>They explained how they receive continuous feedback from each ship through the cloud and analyze it to improve ship design. What stood out was their granular approach: collecting and evaluating data for individual ships rather than aggregating across the ships altogether, and then benchmarking ships of similar size against one another. I learned that CMA CGM equips ships with IoT sensors on engines, hulls, propellers, fuel lines, and cargo holds. Data streams in real time to a centralized cloud platform, tracking engine RPM, fuel consumption, emissions, weather conditions, and sea states.</p>

    <p>Predictive maintenance is made possible by machine-learning models that identify anomalies, greatly lowering unplanned downtime. In order to reduce fuel consumption and enhance schedule dependability, route-optimization algorithms make use of historical voyage data, weather predictions, and insights into port congestion. R&D innovations are then informed by operational feedback, which includes testing energy-recovery systems, modifying propeller pitch, and fine-tuning hull contours. Interactive dashboards show emissions metrics like COâ‚‚ per TEU-nautical mile and trade-offs between emissions and on-time, resulting in a continuous cycle of data-driven improvement.</p>

    <p>It's interesting to note that they aim to get feedback in almost real time in four minutes, but in reality, it can occasionally take up to half an hour for all the data to sync. I now have a greater understanding of how CMA CGM is leading the way in smarter, greener shipping worldwide thanks to my understanding of this end-to-end digital loop, which includes sensors, cloud, analysis, and design.</p>
